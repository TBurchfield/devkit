# Devkit

A series of optionally-compiled tools for software developers. Devkit seeks to
be busybox for dev machines, containing tools too specific to writing code for
other dev toolkits.

Optional compilation on Devkit works across multiple dimensions, optionally
selecting tools (or "modules") to compile into Devkit, on languages that
these tools need to support, and even on standards that these languages may
follow. Languages are only necessary for some components but in these cases
tools are developed as wrappers for a series of language-specific versions
(otherwise syntax)


# Installation

For full install, simply running `make` in the repository root will build the
complete devkit executable for all modules, languages, and standards.
